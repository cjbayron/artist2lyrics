# artist2lyrics

Generate lyrics in the style of your favorite artists :notes:

## Introduction

artist2lyrics is a set of CLI tools that lets you create your own lyrics generator AI, simply by specifiying the artists whose lyrics style you want your AI to imitate. Lyrics crawling, pre-processing, word embeddings generation, model training, and lyrics generation - all basic steps of the lyrics generation pipeline are already handled by this tool! artist2lyrics uses a 2-layer stacked LSTM RNN with dropout to learn lyrics in a word-based manner.

Well then, let's see how this works.

**OPM (Original Philippine Music) Lyrics**
To start off, I'll be using music from my country. Using artist2lyrics, I trained a model on Tagalog songs of THREE of my loved Filipino bands: SugarFree, Itchyworms, and Eraserheads. Now, generating some lyrics...
```
barkada . hawak ang 'yong kamay habang ay hindi . naaalala ka pa . ilaw ikaw sarili ng mundo ng ilalim ng buwan ilalim ng buwan .
```
Hmmm... so this AI seems to be thinking about his friends, a loved one, and the moon. Let's generate some more.
```
bituin sa ating pugad , sa ating pugad sa ating pugad , sa ating pugad . bawat sandali ng aking buhay puno mo ang aking kamay .
```
OK that's pretty sweet. This AI's feeling at home with a loved one.
```
. kahapon lang tayo ay buhay ay yakapin , ako ay buhay buhay ako hay buhay nga naman hay buhay nga naman .
```
Now it's frustrated about life.
Let's try something else.

**Air Supply Lyrics**
After training a model on more than 150 songs of Air Supply, we get these:
```
see stand it the feeling when you're far away i want to take you up in my little world so you'll be here today . when we fly through the night can't you feel the words is the truth of the line .
```
```
let what being here with you taking what is mine just between the tears . i could not more cry i say that i've i thought in heart alright but that heart is a face , can't you thought know just tonight i wanna survive you
```
Well this AI's kinda weird and funny, but surely it wants to sing about love.
Let's try a different genre.

**MCR (My Chemical Romance) Lyrics**
```
right after me you want to kick up you're dead ? . so play a last to remember to the head . i will want . so maybe a sad song with nothin' to do about a life long wait for a hospital about a life about well better know get a our way it's .
```
```
good is you , you , you . me and you and all of these living dead , burning up in the sun where the bodies go , i've on , and on , and on , and on , and on . so the red your - that what's inside you'll a worst from have out gone .
```
Great. I have just raised an emo kid AI.

Okay, generating lyrics sure is fun. Now let's get to more FUN!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL
* Python3
    * numpy, tensorflow, keras, gensim, matplotlib, psycopg2, scikit_learn

see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for specific Python packages versions used

### Database

By default, artist2lyrics uses 'postgres' database to store the crawled lyrics.
To be able to use this database, you need to register your user account as a user:
```
sudo -u postgres createuser <user>
```

## Usage

The pipeline for this tool's lyrics generation is as follows:
Lyrics Crawling -> Pre-processing -> Embeddings Generation -> Model Training -> Lyrics Generation

Each of these are handled by a particular Python script. Before running these, make sure to set desired configuration in _artist2lyrics.cfg_. Importantly, to specify which artist/s you'd want to get lyrics from, set the "artists" field in the config file in comma separated format. For example:
```
artists = airsupply,mychemicalromance
```
Note that for lyrics crawling, we are gathering data from azlyrics.com. The specified names of the artists shall match the name appearing in azlyrics url. For example:
```
https://www.azlyrics.com/m/mychemicalromance.html
https://www.azlyrics.com/a/airsupply.html
```
With these set, you may proceed with execution of the scripts in the following sequence:
1. **crawl_lyrics.py** - lyrics crawling
2. **process_data.py** - data pre-processing and embeddings generation
3. **train_model.py** - model training
4. **generate_lyrics.py** - use trained model for lyrics generation
